## Blurb
This note will be a general outline for my paper discussing how communication and social acceptance have affected the progress of computer science and how they will continue to in the future.

## Outline
### **Introduction**
- Opening statement / Hook
- Note on how short the history of computing is and the fact than many players are still around or recently deceased
- *Non-exaustive statement* 
- General communication and societal acceptance introduction
- The tumultuous history of computer science is a short one filled with many people and organizations 
### **Ada Lovelace**
- *RIT Article*
- Character / Historical Introduction
	- (multiple points)
- Mathematician / Algorithms
- *Needs more clarification / develoment* 
### **Grace Hopper**
- Character / Historical Introduction 
	- (multiple points)
- Compiler
- *Needs more clarification / develoment* 
### **Women In Computing**
- Specific examples of the above characters and other case studies where woman's ideas were thrown aside
- How absolutely revolutionary their ideas were and how they impacted the course of computer science
### **Turing**
- *Past Turing Paper*
- Character / Historical information
	- (multiple points)
- Turing-specific how he was cast out by society
	- End of his life, etc
- How incredibly important his ideas were 
	- Involvement in ending world war 2
	- Formalizing the idea of the universal computer
- What could have been if he hadn't passed at such a young age?
### **Moore**
- *Almost finished with book, will refactor afterwards*
- Character / Historical information
	- (multiple points)
- How communication (or the lack theroef) affected his life (and thus the rest of the world)
	- Early life (primary schooling)
		- Held back
			- Sports
			- Experiments
	- College + Wife
		- Study path
		- Betty
			- Note on Betty's communication history
	- Big Business
### **Poor Communicating Power Players**
- Emphasize how much each of the above personalities has changed the path of technological development in such a short amount of time
- So much of computer science's historical developments occur when the right people find themselves in the right place at the right time
	- Moore's book emphasizes this
		- Find quote about luck favoring the prepared
### **Bell Labs**
- Historical information
	- Formation
- Who was at Bell Labs?
	- Why?
- How was Bell Labs set up?
- How was this set up different than other workplaces of the time?
	- Increasing communication and interdependency and interdisciplinary work
- How did this impact how work was conducted and the output of the group?
### **Moore Book Workplace Para**
- *After finishing Moore book, choose a company he was involved in*
	- Choose either a preferrable or doomed company
- Historical information
	- Formation
- Who was at there?
	- Why?
- How was it set up?
- How was this set up different than other workplaces of the time?
- How did this impact how work was conducted and the output of the group?
### **Flash Back to Reality**
- How are successful workplaces operating now?
	- Are these similar or different from Moore's time?
- Who decides the set ups of these workplaces?
- Are organizations involved in regulating these factors that clearly impact productivity?
	- Communication
	- Social acceptance
- ACM
- 
### **Changes Made and to Make**
- What policies or practices has the world of computer professionals adopted to make these beneficial goals more reasonable?
	- Or which have made it worse?
- Clear issues left unchanged
- What changes can be made now to rectify past issues and prepare the burgeoning field of computer science to remain fruitful?
	- And fair to everyone involved?
### **Conclusion**
- Thesis
- Non-exhaustive reminder / note ?
- Recap professionals mentioned
- Recap changes made
- Recap what can be done next
- Closing statement
